# West-Africa-Crop-Performance

### Project Overview
This project explores the production performance of major crops across West African countries between 2013 and 2022 using data from the FAOSTAT database. The dashboard combines both line and stacked column visuals to track crop trends and country outputs over time.
The goal is to provide policymakers, researchers, and agribusiness stakeholders with interactive insights into crop dynamics, helping support food security, trade, and investment decisions in the region.

### Key Questions
1. What are the top crops produced across West Africa?
2. How does crop production vary over time per country?
3. Which countries lead in the production of specific staple crops?
4. What are the general performance trends of crops over the years?
