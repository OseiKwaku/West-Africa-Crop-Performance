# West-Africa-Crop-Performance

### Project Overview
This project explores the production performance of major crops across West African countries between 2013 and 2022 using data from the FAOSTAT database. The dashboard combines both line and stacked column visuals to track crop trends and country outputs over time.
The goal is to provide policymakers, researchers, and agribusiness stakeholders with interactive insights into crop dynamics, helping support food security, trade, and investment decisions in the region.

### Key Questions
1. What are the top crops produced across West Africa?
2. How does crop production vary over time per country?
3. Which countries lead in the production of specific staple crops?
4. What are the general performance trends of crops over the years?

### Visuals Used
1. Stacked Column Chart: Shows production volumes per crop and country.
2. Line Chart: Tracks time trends of major crops from 1992 to 2022.
3. Slicers: Country, year, and crop filter options.

### Tools Used
1. Power BI – for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
2. Microsoft Excel – for preliminary filtering and formatting.
3. SQL – used for querying, filtering, and transforming raw FAO data.

### Recommendations (Insights from Analysis)
1. Cassava, Yam, and Maize remain dominant staple crops in most countries, especially Nigeria and Ghana.
2. Crop diversification remains low in some countries—investment in varied cultivation may reduce risk.
3. Year-on-year production changes suggest climate effects or policy shifts influencing yields. A regional approach to resilience is needed.
4. Ghana shows steady growth in maize production—potential for export-oriented expansion.
